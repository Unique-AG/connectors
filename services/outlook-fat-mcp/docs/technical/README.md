## Overview

This section contains detailed technical documentation for developers and architects working with the Outlook MCP Server.

**Note:** The Outlook MCP Server is a connector-style MCP server, not a traditional MCP server. It does not provide tools, prompts, resources, or other MCP capabilities. Once connected, it automatically ingests emails into the Unique knowledge base in the background.
