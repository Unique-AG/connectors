# Project Instructions

## Code Comments
- Keep comments minimal - code should be self-explanatory
- Only add comments for complex algorithms, unexpected behavior, or non-obvious business logic
- Add JSDoc comments only for complex methods with multiple parameters or intricate logic
- Avoid obvious comments that just restate what the code does
- Prefer clear variable and function names over explanatory comments

## Code Style
- Write clean, readable code that minimizes the need for comments
- Use descriptive naming conventions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
